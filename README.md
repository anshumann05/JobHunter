# JobHunter
A simple web application for an employer to post jobs, and an employee to view and apply.

# Description
Job Hunter is a web application aimed at allowing the user to search, add and update jobs on a portal. It is intended to allow the candidate to apply for the jobs they are most suitable for. This will include a resume filtering system to filter candidates based on their skills, and give preference to the “best match” or the “nearest match”.
Example: 
If the job requirement says Quality Analyst, there would be a search in the skills for the best matches. After that the other resumes will be filtered randomly.

2. To design a simple system of filtering of resume, to ensure only eligible candidates are processed further

## ROLES FOR THE SYSTEM
